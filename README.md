## Getting Started

Clone this repo then start editing strings located in public/locales/en

Edit experiences in /app 
- /dashboard
- /admin
- /site (landing page)


First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install --force
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Build Settings
Within Vercel, be sure to override the build settings with the following.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Use the sample .env to deploy your application. It will not build correctly without all accurate variables present.
